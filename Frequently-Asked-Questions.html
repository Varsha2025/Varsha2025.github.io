                  <div id="1"><h2>1. Why borrow through Billionloans? </h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Billionloans connects borrowers to lenders directly and efficiently and uses technology to assess eligibility and process applications, thereby reducing transaction costs. This means that, as a borrower, you get access to fair rates, and flexibility to borrow money on your own terms.
                  </p>

                 <div id="2"><h2>2. How does Billionloans work?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;"> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Application: Complete our simple, easy to fill application form with details about you, your income and your work or business. You can either use our convenient e-KYC options or upload specified documents to verify your identity and provide income details.
                  </p>

                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;"> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Scoring: We will use our proprietary Billionloans credit engine to generate an Application Credit Score for you. This will help the banks and NBFCs on our platform to easily take a decision about your loan.
                  </p>

                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;"> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Decision: Based on your loan needs, we will forward your scored loan application to the appropriate lender. Once your loan is approved, we will assist you in completing the required loan documentation with the lender so that you can start using your loan funds at the earliest.
                  </p>


                 <div id="3"><h2>3. How do I get started?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Sign up through the simple step by step process as instructed. Once you have filled the basic information required and we have completed the e-KYC process, you will be asked for more detailed information that will allow us to better match your requirements with the lenders on our platform. We will also ask you to upload some documents to support the details provided by you. The Billionloans risk assessment team will then review your details and decide whether your profile can be included in our borrower database. Once your profile is approved in the risk review process, it will be sent to the appropriate lender for a final decision.  </p>


                 <div id="4"><h2>4. Why do you require the supporting documents that you are asking for?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">The documents are required to verify your identity and asses your credit-worthiness before registration. Apart from the CIBIL score, we use various other parameters like ability to pay, income stability, past performance and intention of the borrowers, which are evaluated on the basis of these documents.</p>

                   <div id="5"><h2>5. How much can I borrow?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Loan disbursal is dependent on the type of loan requirement as well as other parameters like income and credit strength. The maximum loan amount differs from product to product and is more specifically stated in the product description on our website. Please note that the final amount you may be eligible for could be lower than the maximum allowed and will be decided based on the credit assessment of your profile.</p>

                 <div id="5"><h2>6. What is the tenure of loans on Billionloans?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Loan tenure depends on your loan requirement as well as other parameters like income and credit strength. The maximum loan tenure differs from product to product and is more specifically stated in the product description on our website. Please note that the final tenure you may be eligible for could be lower than the maximum allowed and will be decided based on the credit assessment of your profile.</p>

                   <div id="7"><h2>7. Can I pre-pay my EMI? Can I repay my loan early if I like? Are there any charges?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Pre-payment charges if any are specified by lenders while entering into a loan contract. This is payable directly to lenders. Billionloans does not charge any pre-payment fees.</p>

                   <div id="8"><h2>8. What rates can I expect to pay?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Interest rates charged to you depend on your loan requirement as well as other parameters like income and credit strength. Interest rates differ from product to product and are more specifically stated in the product description on our website. Please note that what is indicated is a range and the final interest rate charged could be within the range or outside it based on the credit assessment of your profile.</p>

                   <div id="9"><h2>9. On what parameters does Billionloans verify my profile and check my credit-worthiness?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">We use a highly-developed, technology-driven process of verification across various criteria based on the personal and financial information and documents provided by the borrower. Each borrower’s identity is verified against government databases and credit risk assessed using a methodology designed by our experienced team. The ability to repay, income stability and intention of borrowers is evaluated.</p>

                   <div id="10"><h2>10. How long is the disbursal process?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">The time for disbursal includes the time taken to verify your identity, assess your creditworthiness and complete loan documentation. The time taken for each of these steps varies from case to case and is dependent on many things, including the completeness of documentation submitted to support the loan. We follow up with the respective lenders to ensure that disbursal is completed as soon as possible. Our aim is to complete the post-documentation loan disbursal within a week.</p>

                  <div id="11"> <h2>11. Why was my application declined?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Billionloans can decline to proceed with an application if the borrower and/or application does not meet its internal credit worthiness criteria. The decision to lend or not is based on the evaluation of multiple criteria and is not linked to any one parameter. In addition, the borrower’s application will be declined if KYC cannot be verified, documentation is incomplete or cannot be authenticated, physical verification of the borrower’s address is negative or if the borrower is found to have provided incorrect, incomplete or misleading information with the intent to cheat Billionloans, its employees, directors, its customers, or any other entity associated with it.</p>

                 <div id="12"><h2>12. Are loans secured? What collateral do loans require?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Currently, business loans on Billionloansare unsecured obligations and do not require collateral. Home loans and education loans will usually require mortgage of property.</p>

                <div id="13"> <h2>13. What happens in case of delayed or non-payment of EMI?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">In case a borrower does not pay the EMI by the due date, penal interest will be applied to the amount due for the duration of delay. Additionally, collection charges will be levied by Billionloans. Billionloans will support our lenders in exploring all available legal methods for recovery of their funds including the initiation of legal proceeding where required.</p>

                  <div id="14"> <h2>14. Are there any hidden charges?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">No, there are no hidden charges. We charge the lender a fee after a loan is sanctioned. There are currently no charges to be paid by borrowers.</p>


                 <div id="15"><h2>15. Can I change the loan amount I want to borrow after applying?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">No, you cannot make changes to details of a loan once you have applied. Any changes, including a reduction in loan amount, that are required to comply with Billionloans’ policies will be communicated to you and made by us after your agreement.</p>

                   <div id="16"><h2>16. How do I cancel my loan application?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Please write to <a href="#">support@billionloans.com</a> requesting cancellation of your registration as Borrower. Loan cancellation can only happen prior to disbursal of funds.</p>

                  <div id="17"> <h2>17. How do I change my bank details?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Please write to <a href="#">support@billionloans.com </a>stating both your old and new bank details and we will inform you of the documents required to make the change.</p>


                 <div id="18"><h2>18. Why is Billionloans asking me permission to access my bank account details?</h2></div>
                  <p class="pt-2" style="line-height:28px; font-size:16px; text-align:justify;">Billionloans verifies the financial documents submitted by the borrower(s) which takes a lot of time and can delay the listing of a loan request. Accordingly, where available, we use automatic feeds from financial institutions to speed up the verification and assessment process to help fund loan application faster.</p>


                 <div id="19"><h2>19. What are the eligibility criteria for borrowers?</h2></div>
